I have worked on these repo's for a very long time. I started in September 2007.

I am not retiring, I am just changing the way I do things. All Repo's have been moved to
http://git.realmsofwarcraft.com

Some Repo's will be private and some public. I will still work on patches, databases and
full cores. All private Repo's will be accessible to those who really want it. Check the
individual repo for instructions on how to access.
